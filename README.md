Hi everyone. This is my first Data Analysis Project using Python.
This project shows the analysis of sales(imaginary data) during diwali all over India.
We can see that women did more purchases than men.
Most them are from IT,healthcare and Aviation sectors majorly.
The major purchases were food, electronics and gadgets, and clothing and apparels.
The highest sales happened in UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka.
